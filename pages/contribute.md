I am always looking for contributions. Here are some easy ways you can help:


#### Writing Tests

Some sections of Cello are fairly spare on tests. This is a great way to ensure there are no bugs in the project and to aid understanding.


#### Benchmarking

I'm dying to get some benchmarking results but haven't had the time to write them. The comparisons don't have to be complex at first. Anything is a good start.


#### Library Contributions

There are still lots of potential additions to the standard library including data structures such as _Sets_, _Linked Lists_, _Generators_ or things like _Sockets_ and _Regular Expressions_.

All of these and anything else that can be thought of would be welcome additions.
