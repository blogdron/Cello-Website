
Development is done via the [github](https://github.com/orangeduck/libCello) repository.

I am always looking for contributions. Here are some easy ways you can help:


#### Writing Tests

Some sections of Cello are fairly spare on tests. Writing some tests may be boring but it is a great way to learn how to use libCello effectively while also contributing to the project.


#### Benchmarking

I'm dying to get some benchmarking results but haven't had the time to set up a system. Any comparison is a good start so I'm not looking for anything too complex at first.


#### Library Contributions

There are still lots of potential additions to the standard library including things such as
  
  * Sets
  * Linked Lists
  * Generators
  * Sockets
  * Regular Expressions
  * Threads
  * _Anything else_
